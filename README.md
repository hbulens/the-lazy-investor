The lazy investor is an investment portfolio management application for the average Joe who intends to hold his assets for a long time.

## Getting Started

This application is split into two distinct areas. Unsurprisingly, there's a front-end and a back-end attached to the lazy investor.

To run the server, run the command `dotnet run` for the web project.
To run the client, execute the command `yarn start`.

### Prerequisites

The front-end application is a simple Angular application. We recommend to use **yarn** as the package manager.

The back-end system is a ASP.NET Core 3.x solution. It is recommended to have Visual Studio 2019 Community or higher.

## Running the tests

Run `dotnet test` for the server app and `yarn test` for the client app.

## Deployment

Run `dotnet publish` for the server app and `yarn build` for the client app

## Built With

* ASP.NET Core
* Angular 9
